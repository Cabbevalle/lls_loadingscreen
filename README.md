# [Little Los Santos](lls.gg) - [Hacktober](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

Welcome! A little background first, Little Los Santos is an online FiveM community formally known as London Life RP `(LLRP)` . As many people know we use custom resources for all of our systems and we wanted to give you a little look! Over the next couple of weeks (25th September - 18th Octoboer) we will be allowing our community to create, design and code new ideas into our loading screen.

The loading screen is the first thing you see joining the server and we want to show new players the community we have within. The best way we thought of doing that was to get the community to make it!

## What is [Hacktober](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)?

Hacktober is a month-long event spanning October where developers around the world are encouraged to contribute towards open-source projects. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) a hosting company every year make this possible and also throw some goodies in too! 

### You say goodies?

Yes! Stickers, discounts and even a T-Shirt! All you need to do is make **4** what we call **pull requests**. You could think a pull request like an invitation, asking the code owner(s) if they like your chances and if they want to merge/incorporate your changes and code. 

*TL:DR - make 4 pull requests on open-source software/code and get some free stuff!*
